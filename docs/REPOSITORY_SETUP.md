### Develop Branch Protection (Optional)

If using a develop branch for integration:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup-repo.sh - Automated repository setup

# Set branch protection for main
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["Lint and Format","Type Check","Test Python 3.12 on ubuntu-latest","Security Scan","Build Distribution"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1,"dismiss_stale_reviews":true}' \
  --field restrictions=null

# Enable security features
gh api repos/:owner/:repo --method PATCH \
  --field has_vulnerability_alerts=true \
  --field has_dependabot_alerts=true \
  --field has_dependabot_security_updates=true

echo "Repository configured successfully!"
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks
- Review Dependabot PRs
- Check security alerts
- Review failed workflow runs

### Monthly Tasks
- Review and update branch protection rules
- Audit repository access permissions
- Update documentation as needed

### Quarterly Tasks
- Review and update CI/CD workflows
- Security audit of dependencies
- Performance review of build times

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### CI Fails on First Run
- Ensure all required secrets are configured
- Check that branch protection rules match workflow job names
- Verify Python version compatibility

#### Type Checking Failures
- Ensure basedpyright is properly installed in CI
- Check that py.typed file is included in package
- Validate typing configuration

#### PyPI Publishing Failures
- Verify PYPI_API_TOKEN is correctly configured
- Check that package name is available on PyPI
- Ensure version number follows semantic versioning

For additional help, check the workflow logs in the Actions tab or create an issue.
