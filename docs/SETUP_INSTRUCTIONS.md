  - Build Distribution
  - Validate Installation

☑️ Require conversation resolution before merging
☑️ Restrict pushes to matching branches
☐ Force push (not allowed)
☐ Allow deletions (not allowed)
```

## Step 3: Repository Secrets

### 3.1 Create PyPI API Token

1. Go to [PyPI Account Settings](https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/)
2. Click "Add API token"
3. Name: `nwws-oi-receiver-ci`
4. Scope: `Entire account` (or project-specific after first upload)
5. Copy the token (starts with `pypi-`)

### 3.2 Add Secrets to GitHub

Navigate to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

```
Repository secrets:
Name: PYPI_API_TOKEN
Value: pypi-AgEIcHlwaS5vcmcC... (your token)

Optional secrets:
Name: CODECOV_TOKEN  
Value: (if using Codecov for coverage)
```

### 3.3 Create Environment

Navigate to **Settings → Environments**:

```
Environment name: pypi

Deployment protection rules:
☑️ Required reviewers: [your-username]
☑️ Wait timer: 0 minutes

Environment secrets:
Name: PYPI_API_TOKEN
Value: pypi-AgEIcHlwaS5vcmcC... (same token)
```

## Step 4: File Validation

Verify all configuration files are in place:

### 4.1 Check Workflow Files
```bash
ls -la .github/workflows/
# Should show: ci.yml, release.yml, dependency-update.yml
```

### 4.2 Check Templates
```bash
ls -la .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
# Should show: bug_report.yml, feature_request.yml

ls -la .github/
# Should show: CODEOWNERS, dependabot.yml, pull_request_template.md
```

### 4.3 Check Scripts
```bash
ls -la scripts/
# Should show: release.py (executable)

chmod +x scripts/release.py  # Make executable if needed
```

## Step 5: Initial Validation

### 5.1 Test Local Build
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --dev

# Run validation
uv run python scripts/validate_typing.py

# Test build
uv run python -m build
```

### 5.2 Test Release Script
```bash
# Check current setup
python scripts/release.py check

# This should pass all pre-release checks
```

## Step 6: First CI Run

### 6.1 Push Configuration
```bash
# Add all new files
git add .github/ scripts/ docs/ .pre-commit-config.yaml

# Commit
git commit -m "ci: add comprehensive CI/CD pipeline and release automation"

# Push to trigger first CI run
git push origin main
```

### 6.2 Monitor First Run

1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Watch the CI workflow run
3. Fix any issues that arise
4. Common first-run issues:
   - Missing dependencies in CI
   - Path issues in workflows
   - Permission problems

## Step 7: Pre-commit Setup (Optional)

### 7.1 Install Pre-commit
```bash
# Install pre-commit
uv add --dev pre-commit

# Install hooks
uv run pre-commit install

# Test hooks
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 7.2 Configure Git Hooks
```bash
# Install both pre-commit and pre-push hooks
uv run pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit
uv run pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```

## Step 8: Test Release Process

### 8.1 Create Test Release

**Option A: Using Release Script**
```bash
# Create a test release (don't push tag yet)
python scripts/release.py release --version "1.0.0" --dry-run
```

**Option B: Manual Test**
```bash
# Update version manually
sed -i 's/version = ".*"/version = "1.0.0"/' pyproject.toml

# Test build
uv run python -m build

# Validate
uv run python scripts/validate_typing.py
```

### 8.2 Test Tag Creation
```bash
# Create and push tag to test release workflow
git tag v1.0.0-test
git push origin v1.0.0-test

# Monitor release workflow in Actions tab
# Delete test tag afterward:
git tag -d v1.0.0-test
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0-test
```

## Step 9: Documentation Updates

### 9.1 Update README Badges

Add to your README.md:
```markdown
[![CI](https://github.com/your-username/nwws-oi-receiver/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/your-username/nwws-oi-receiver/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

[![Type checked: basedpyright](https://img.shields.io/badge/type%20checker-basedpyright-informational)](https://github.com/DetachHead/basedpyright)
```

### 9.2 Add Security Policy

Create `SECURITY.md`:
```markdown
# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Step 12: First Production Release

### 12.1 Prepare for Release
```bash
# Ensure main branch is clean and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Run full validation
python scripts/release.py check
```

### 12.2 Create Release
```bash
# Create first production release
python scripts/release.py release --version "1.0.0"

# Or using GitHub UI:
# 1. Go to Releases → Create new release
# 2. Tag: v1.0.0
# 3. Title: Release v1.0.0  
# 4. Description: Initial stable release
# 5. Publish release
```

### 12.3 Verify Release
```bash
# Wait for workflow to complete, then test:
pip install nwws-oi-receiver==1.0.0
python -c "import wx_wire; print(wx_wire.__version__)"
```

## Troubleshooting
